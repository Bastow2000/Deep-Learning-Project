# Deep-Learning-Project
Pitch and Instrument indication:
While the concept of the project could have been more refined, I am sharing it here to showcase the effort and dedication I put into it, even if the outcome seems modest. This project has provided me with a solid foundation in deep learning, which I intend to build upon for future experiments and endeavors.
